# Fundamentals of Programming

This repo contains sample code and other examples from the 2022 version of *Fundamentals of
Computer Programming*.

The code is provided "as is". You may well need access to the module materials on MyBeckett in
order to follow what's going on. Much of the code has an accompanying video on there.

The code may contain errors, and, indeed, [cruft](http://hackersdictionary.com/html/entry/cruft.html).
