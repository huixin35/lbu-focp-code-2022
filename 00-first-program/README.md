This folder contains:

* `hello_world.py` - the canonical first program, that prints a cheery message to standard output 
  (usually the screen).
* `hello_name.py` - the canonical second program, where the user enters their name and receives a
  cheery and personalised message.

There are examples here of basic input and output, along with the
use of a built-in function to capitalise the user's
names. The second program uses an f-string.
